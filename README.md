# CreatPix
Pixel Art Creator App to practice JavaScript, HTML &amp; CSS

FOR  VERSION 2:
-Tried to make created grid responsive, but I'll do that in a seperate version of the project, where I'll make the squares actually 1x1px instead of 18x18px like it is now.
-Get it to work on mobile (right now it only works if i click, but not when i hold on mobile). I should use jQuery, because touchmove doesn't work like a hover event.
